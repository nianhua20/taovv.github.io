I am a three-year M.S. student at the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University (SZU),
supervised by Prof. Zhihui Lai. Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from
Guilin University of Electronic Technology (GUET) in 2020. 

My research interests are in Computer Vision, including but
not limited to _Medical Image Segmentation / Semantic Segmentation / Semi-supervised Learning / Self-supervised Learning_.
